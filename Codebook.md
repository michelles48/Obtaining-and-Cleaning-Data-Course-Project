The run_analysis.R script was designed to do all of the follow commands:
-'Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set'.
-'Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement'.
-'Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set'.
-'Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names'.
-'From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject'. (Credit:ProjectInstructions)

Dataset Main Source
-Data used on this project was obtained from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Labels :
features <- features.txt : features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope of Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
activities <- activity_labels.txt:Its the List of activities executed when the appropiate measurements were taken and its labels
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : test data of  volunteer test subjects studied
x_test <-X_test.txt :Marked features test data
y_test <- y_test.txt : test data of activities codes
subject_train <- subject_train.txt: Train data ofvolunteer subjects studied
x_train <- X_train.txt: recorded features train data
x_train <- X_train.txt:train data of activities codes

X was generated by merging x_train and x_test 
Y was generated  by merging y_train and y_test
Subject was generated by merging subject_train and subject_test
MergedData was generated by merging Subject, Y and X 

Description of variables:

Acc on columns name substituted from Accelerometer
All Gyro on columns name substituted from Gyroscope
All BodyBody on columns name substituted from Body
All Mag on columns name substituted from Magnitude
All start with ^ f on columns name substituted from Frequency
All start with ^ t on columns name substituted from Time


-TidyData generated by gathering information of interest(merged_data).
Information of interest:Code,subject,and measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
