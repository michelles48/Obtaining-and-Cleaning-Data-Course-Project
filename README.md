##Run Analysis Script was designed to do all of the follow commands:
-'Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set'.
-'Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement'.
-'Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set'.
-'Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names'.
-'From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject'. (Credit:ProjectInstructions)

##Dataset Includes the following Files:
x_train and x_test = Training Set
y_train and y_test= Training Labels
Finaldata.txt = Shows overall information about the variables used
